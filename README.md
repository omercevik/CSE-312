C++ & MIPS Assembly Projects 

Working Operating System:

        Linux Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
        Terminal Command Line
        SPIM Simulator

HW 1 -> Shell Program runs Linear Search, Binary Search, Show Divisible Numbers and Selection Sort Programs
        
        In spim directory to run:
        sudo make install
        ./spim -file asm/Shell.asm
        
        When the shell is openned enter the test assembly files with their path.

HW 2 -> Three Different Strategy of Microkernel using Round Robin Scheduler

        In spim directory to run:
        sudo make install
        ./spim -file SPIMOS_GTU_1.s
        ./spim -file SPIMOS_GTU_2.s
        ./spim -file SPIMOS_GTU_3.s
        
Midterm -> File System
        
        make (Part 3)
       
HW 3 -> Three Different Strategy of Microkernel in Assembly using Round Robin Scheduler

        In spim directory to run:
        sudo make install
        ./spim -file SPIMOS_GTU_1.s
        ./spim -file SPIMOS_GTU_2.s
        ./spim -file SPIMOS_GTU_3.s

Final -> Virtual Memory Simulation
        
        For Part 2
        make
        make run
        
        For Part 3
        make
        make run
