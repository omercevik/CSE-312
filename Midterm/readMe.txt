Notes:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  There is no compilation or run time error that I detected.
2.  Bonus commands are not implemented (ln, lnsym, fsck).
3.  commands.txt includes the tested commands and they are also available in Part 3 Makefile.
4.  All Makefile files and reports are in the zip files.
5.  C++ Programming Language and g++ (Ubuntu 9.3.0-10ubuntu2) 9.3.0 version is used to compile and run.
6.  I send the source files and runnable files in zip files.
