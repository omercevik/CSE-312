Important Notes:
----------------
1.  Part 2 and Part 3 programs successfully compiles and runs in VM.

2.  To compile Part 2 -> make

3.  To run Part 2 -> make run

4.  To compile Part 3 -> make

5.  To run Part 3 -> make run

6.  Part 3 Bonus Program is attached to Part 3 as code and runs after Part 3 code.

7.  Part 2 takes too long time where run command is ./sortArrays 12 5 10 LRU local 10000 diskFileName.dat
    Because the values are too much. I have waited at least 1 hour and 30 minutes and it didn't fail. Just continued to process.

8.  For Part 2 I used that commands to show results in short way : ./sortArrays 10 4 7 LRU local 10000 diskFileName.dat
    It also takes 10-15 minutes to finish.

9.  All parts are completed successfully and detailed in Part_1.pdf.

10. Part 3 takes also 10-15 minutes to finish. Details are in the Part_1.pdf.

11. I send my own Makefiles for Part 2 Makefile in Part_2 directory and Part 3 Makefile in Part_3 directory.
